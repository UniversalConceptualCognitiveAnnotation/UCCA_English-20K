“ Bah ! ” he replied . “ Nothing ’s out there , Professor Aronnax , and if there is some animal , what chance would we have of spotting it ? Can ’t you see we ’re just wandering around at random ? People say they ’ve sighted this slippery beast again in the Pacific high seas — I ’m truly willing to believe it , but two months have already gone by since then , and judging by your narwhale ’s personality , it hates growing moldy from hanging out too long in the same waterways ! It ’s blessed with a terrific gift for getting around . Now , professor , you know even better than I that nature does n’t violate good sense , and she would n’t give some naturally slow animal the ability to move swiftly if it had n’t a need to use that talent . So if the beast does exist , it ’s already long gone ! ”
