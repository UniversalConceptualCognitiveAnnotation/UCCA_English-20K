A devoted lad who went with me on all my journeys ; a gallant Flemish boy whom I genuinely liked and who returned the compliment ; a born stoic , punctilious on principle , habitually hardworking , rarely startled by life 's surprises , very skillful with his hands , efficient in his every duty , and despite his having a name that means " counsel , " never giving advice - not even the unsolicited kind !
