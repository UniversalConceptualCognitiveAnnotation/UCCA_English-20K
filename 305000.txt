" In essence , the narwhale is armed with a sort of ivory sword , or lance , as certain naturalists have expressed it . It 's a king - sized tooth as hard as steel . Some of these teeth have been found buried in the bodies of baleen whales , which the narwhale attacks with invariable success . Others have been wrenched , not without difficulty , from the undersides of vessels that narwhales have pierced clean through , as a gimlet pierces a wine barrel . The museum at the Faculty of Medicine in Paris owns one of these tusks with a length of 2.25 meters and a width at its base of forty - eight centimeters !
