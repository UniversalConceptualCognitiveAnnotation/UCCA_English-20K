" Bosh ! " Ned replied . " You can make figures do anything you want ! " " In business , Ned , but not in mathematics . Listen to me . Let 's accept that the pressure of one atmosphere is represented by the pressure of a column of water thirty - two feet high . In reality , such a column of water would n't be quite so high because here we 're dealing with salt water , which is denser than fresh water . Well then , when you dive under the waves , Ned , for every thirty - two feet of water above you , your body is tolerating the pressure of one more atmosphere , in other words , one more kilogram per each square centimeter on your body 's surface . So it follows that at 320 feet down , this pressure is equal to ten atmospheres , to 100 atmospheres at 3,200 feet , and to 1,000 atmospheres at 32,000 feet , that is , at about two and a half vertical leagues down . Which is tantamount to saying that if you could reach such a depth in the ocean , each square centimeter on your body 's surface would be experiencing 1,000 kilograms of pressure . Now , my gallant Ned , do you know how many square centimeters you have on your bodily surface ? "
