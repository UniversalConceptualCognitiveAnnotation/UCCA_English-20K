“ You see , my friend , it ’s an issue of the monster , the notorious narwhale . We ’re going to rid the seas of it ! The author of a two - volume work , in quarto , on The Mysteries of the Great Ocean Depths has no excuse for not setting sail with Commander Farragut . It ’s a glorious mission but also a dangerous one ! We do n’t know where it will take us ! These beasts can be quite unpredictable ! But we ’re going just the same ! We have a commander who ’s game for anything ! ”
