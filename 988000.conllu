# text = A request to this effect was presented to the commander. The commander stood his ground. His sailors could n’t hide their discontent, and their work suffered because of it. I ’m unwilling to say that there was mutiny on board, but after a reasonable period of intransigence, Commander Farragut, like Christopher Columbus before him, asked for a grace period of just three days more. After this three-day delay, if the monster had n’t appeared, our helmsman would give three turns of the wheel, and the Abraham Lincoln would chart a course toward European seas.
